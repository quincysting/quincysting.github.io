      <title>Completed four NANOs at Udacity</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have known Udacity for quite a while but didn’t have chance to try it out. During “Great Lockdown”, I finally have time to sit down and finish four NANOs. </p><p>Unlike Coursera or some other trainings I did in the past, Udacity is very hands-on with plenty projects in Python coding, DevOps and AI/Deep Learning. There are not much theories. The course material is designed to help you complete those projects.</p><p>Usually it takes three months to finish one NANO degree given about 10 hours workload per week. But I chose to pay only one month subscription and try to finish it without further renew. Overall it’s quite a challenging experience. I feel it’s quite difficult to stay motivated, study independendly and look for answers by self when got stuck in projects.</p><p>Deep Learning is probably the best course material I have ever seen in the market these days. Just be aware you need to understand discrete mathematics, algebra and have intermediate level of Python programming. But don’t worry, Udacity finds ways to light you up when you go through the course. Personally I feel even without strong coding experience, you still can give it try. AI/Deep Learning is very popular subject. These days even a product manager still needs to know some fundamental concepts like CNN and underlying instruments like AWS SageMaker to implement the product. </p><p>Predictive Analytics for Business is all about Alteryx. Alteryx is such a powerful analytics tool integrated with R. I like the workflow design and off the shelf packages for tasks like data wrangling, A/B testing, time series forecasting and clustering. Alteryx makes analytics much easier with clear logic. That’s why a lot consulting firms are using it.</p><p>Cloud DevOps Engineer introduces some best engineering practices in industry like Kubernetes, pipeline and CI/CD. There are some projects implemented on top of AWS which is such a popular platform. From here, I decided to take AWS Solution Architect exam and get to know about this amazing product.</p><p>Other than that, I start to use Github heavily. Github starts to become one stop shop for developers with IDE, CD/CD and release control all in one place. I actually build my personal site on top of Github.</p><img src="/images/certificates.jpg" class="" width="1000" title="Udacity NANOs"><p>Please see the list of NANOs in case you are interested.</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Learning</a></li><li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-product-manager-nanodegree--nd088" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Product Manager</a></li><li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/predictive-analytics-for-business-nanodegree--nd008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Predictive Analytics for Business</a></li><li><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-dev-ops-nanodegree--nd9991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloud DevOps Engineer</a></li></ol>]]></content>
